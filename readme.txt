klimalogg - Weewx driver for TFA KlimaLogg Pro
Version 1.1.4
Copyright 2016 Luc Heijst

Klimalogg ia a weewx extension to read data from the KlimaLogg Pro
station and up to 8 thermo/hygro sensors. It saves data to its own database,
then those data can be displayed in weewx reports.  This extension also
includes a sample skin that illustrates how to use the data.

Installation instructions:

1) Install weewx with the Simulator driver

2) Run the installer for klimalogg:

  wee_extension --install kl-x.y.z.tar.gz

3) Replace the simulator driver with the klimalogg driver

  wee_config --reconfigure --driver=user.kl --no-prompt

4) modify weewx.conf

4a) Specify the kl_binding instead of wx_binding.  Klimalogg works best with
    its own schema, not the wview schema that is the default for weewx.  To
    make this happen you must change the data binding from wx_binding to
    kl_binding in two places, the StdReport and StdArchive sections

    data_binding = kl_binding

4a) Optionally remove the [Simulator] driver section; it is no longer needed.

4b) Optionally remove the [[StandardReport]] section of [StdReport].
    The KlimaLogg is not a 'standard' weather station, so the graphs and
    reports in skin Standard will not work properly.

5) restart weewx:

sudo /etc/init.d/weewx stop
sudo /etc/init.d/weewx start

klimalogg - Weewx driver for TFA KlimaLogg Pro
Copyright 2016 Luc Heijst

Klimalogg ia a weewx extension to read data from the KlimaLogg Pro
station and up to 8 thermo/hygro sensors. It saves data to its own database,
then those data can be displayed in weewx reports.  This extension also
includes a sample skin that illustrates how to use the data.

Installation instructions:

1) Install weewx, select Simulator as the weather station

  (follow instructions in the weewx user guide)

2) Download the klimalogg driver

  wget https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-klimalogg/archive/master.zip

3) Install the klimalogg driver and skin

  wee_extension --install weewx-klimalogg-master.zip

4) Replace the simulator driver with the klimalogg driver

  wee_config --reconfigure --driver=user.kl --no-prompt

5) restart weewx:

  sudo /etc/init.d/weewx stop
  sudo /etc/init.d/weewx start


Beware that this installation process will modify weewx.conf:

  Change wx_binding to kl_binding.  Klimalogg works best with its own schema,
  not the wview schema that is the default for weewx.  This requires a change
  the data binding from wx_binding to kl_binding in two places, the StdReport
  and StdArchive sections

  Remove the [Simulator] driver section if it exists.

  Remove the [[StandardReport]] section of [StdReport] if it exists.  The
  KlimaLogg is not a 'standard' weather station, so the graphs and reports
  in skin Standard will not work properly.
